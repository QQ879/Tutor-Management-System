# Tutor-Management-System
This system uses different data structures and algorithms. It is developed in both linked list and array editions. The used sorting and search algorithms are merge sort, quick sort, jump search and linear search.

The system is using a console-based table structure for output formatting. Here's the repository for the structuring code https://github.com/766F6964/ConsoleTable.
